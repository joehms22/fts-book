A Better Stemmer
================

Please note that this section covers a topic that won't be used in the final 
program, but is interesting none-the-less, especially in non-English, latin 
based languages where it is likely much more useful.

Stemming
--------
In stemming, we modify source words so they match the original root of the word
being searched, thus:

        whales -> whale
        whaling -> whale
        whaled -> whale
        man-whale -> man + whale

There are [several different algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming#Algorithms)
 for accomplishing this, the one we are going to implement is suffix 
stripping, as it is the simplest, it works by removing the common 
suffixes to words, like ing, ed, or ly. Of course, this will only work
for English, but stemming algorithms must be fine-tuned to a specific
language due to the inherent structural differences between them.
[Here is a page featuring stemmers](http://snowball.tartarus.org/) for other languages.

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	
	def stemmer(word):
		''' A simple stemmer for English. '''
		for suffix in ["ing","ly","ed"]:
			if word.endswith(suffix):
				return word[:- len(suffix)]
		return word

The advantages of using such a simple stemmer is chiefly speed and
maintainability. 
There is no need to look up a particular word, which would mean 
leaving a rather large table in-memory, and we can optimize the heck
out of these eight lines of code to ensure they are fast.

Of course, it isn't without its disadvantages, words like "whaling" won't come
out right, and strange words like "went" won't properly map to "go" where goed 
would be expected. It is times like this where [Esperanto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) 
starts to look very pretty indeed.


While the stemmer presented earlier is certainly fast, the problem is that it
doesn't do a good job for the English language, as there are far too many 
irregularities. A better one is the [PORTER2 algorithm](http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/english/stemmer.html)

The algorithm is described in [Snowball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_%28programming_language%29)
on the page given, and can quickly be translated to Python, as seen below, but 
it isn't as fast as simply stripping ing, ly, and ed.

If it is certain all documents will be in English, this isn't a bad way to go, 
as stemming will save index space.

Method
------

The PORTER2 algorithm works by doing the following to a word:

1. Finds the y's that are considered vowels.
1. Removes possessive suffixes.
1. Removes plural parts of the word.
1. Removes portions of the word that make it past tense.
1. Removes suffixes that change nouns to verbs, getting a true root word.
1. Remove extra letters left by chopping that normally are added to append suffixes


The full text for this stemmer can be found in the code directory under 
`stemmer.py`. The implementation may not be very well documented
