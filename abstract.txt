Over the past ten years the amount of digitized information available online has grown at a breakneck speed. In order to properly sort through all of that information, people have come to use increasingly sophisticated search engines that have transitioned from being simple databases to something else entirely, full text indexes that use a reversed document structure for locating things. These indexes have allowed the fast and seemingly magical search ability we have come to expect; no longer do users need to enter an exact term, precariously choosing ANDs and ORs from drop-downs to craft the perfect search. Instead, a simpler interface has overtaken the web, a single text-box and button.

This course was designed to demonstrate that it doesn't take years of study to be able to create a well-working full text index that can compete with much better funded competitors, such as the big search engine companies; rather it takes a little bit of insight in to how reversing the way we look at documents allows all of this to happen with a little code implementing conceptually simple algorithms. This course covered and joined together a lexer, parser, indexer, database storage mechanism, query interpreter, ranker and web server to create a simple full text search engine that is efficient and compact; however this engine has a surprising ability to do complex queries, easily lending itself to potential real-world applications.
