Flat File Table
===============

Introduction
------------
This table is going to use a flat file format.

It will contain three seperate files to store the data (later on these may be 
split up so they can be paged more efficiently.)

Each of these files is JSON formatted, BSON is a possability, but for a
relatively few number of documents, it won't be beneficial, as
[encoding takes almost fifty times longer than JSON](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9884080/fastest-packing-of-data-in-python-and-java)
in the version available through the Python repositories.


File Description
----------------
**terms.json**

This file will contain all the terms (words) for the documents,
their frequency, and the locations of the term in the document. Its
structure will look like this:

	{
		"term":[<document1>, <document2>, ... ],
		"term2":[<document3>, <document1>],
		"term3":[<document0>],
		...
	}

The document will be a large JSON dictionary, where each term/word will
be mapped to a list of "documents" that have that term. Each "document"
will be an independent object, that looks like the following:

	{
		id : 00001,
		frequency : 3,
		locations : [ -1, 2, 15]
	}

The document id will be the id of the document found in documents.json,
the frequency is the number of times the particular term is found in a
document.

If space is a concern, locations do not need to be stored.

**metadata.json**

This document will contain all of the metadata for the documents.
You will be able to search metadata by using a key->value type approach,
similar to the way Lucene or Google work, e.g.

	site:google.com
	type:pdf
	color:blue

In this way, we will store keys, the values within those keys, and the
documents associated with those values:

	{
		"key" : {
					"value" : [ 99, 213, 2912, ... , 200 ],
					"value2" : [ 502, 99, 237, ... , 292 ],
					...
				},
		"site" : {
					"google.com" : [ 2812, 282, 3302, ..., 281 ],
					"yahoo.com" : [ 5002, 382, 123, ..., 3 ],
					...
				},
		...
	}

This file will grow rather quickly, but should prove invaluable for
advanced searches.


**documents.json**

This document will contain key->location relationships for all the
documents. Additional information, such as index date can be included.
This way, documents can be re-indexed as needed, and marked dirty or
not.

	{
		1 : {
				"uri":"http://localhost/foo/bar/baz.tgz",
				"dirty":false,
				"last_indexed":1349285940.527592
			},
		2 : {
				"uri":"file://home/joseph/Desktop/flat_file.md",
				"dirty":true,
				"last_indexed":1349285944.527592
			},
		...
	}


Software Design
---------------

The server will contain several components:

1. A web server to intercept HTTP calls and to handle them.
1. The database query backend, used to load/store.
1. The query parser, used to return relevant results to users.
1. The database submission backend.
