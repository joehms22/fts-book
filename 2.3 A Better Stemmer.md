A Better Stemmer
================

Introduction
------------

While the stemmer presented earlier is certainly fast, the problem is that it
doesn't do a good job for the English language, as there are far too many 
irregularities. A better one is the [PORTER2 algorithm](http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/english/stemmer.html)

The algorithm is described in [Snowball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_%28programming_language%29)
on the page given, and can quickly be translated to Python, as seen below, but 
it isn't as fast as simply stripping ing, ly, and ed.

If it is certain all documents will be in English, this isn't a bad way to go, 
as stemming will save index space.

Method
------

The PORTER2 algorithm works by doing the following to a word:

1. Finds the y's that are considered vowels.
1. Removes possessive suffixes.
1. Removes plural parts of the word.
1. Removes portions of the word that make it past tense.
1. Removes suffixes that change nouns to verbs, getting a true root word.
1. Remove extra letters left by chopping that normally are added to append suffixes
